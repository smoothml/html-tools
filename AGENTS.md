This project contains a selection of web-based tools. Each tool is contained within a single `.html` file and is immplemented using only HTML and plain JavaScript.

## Rules

* Each tool must be completely self-contained within a single `.html` file.
* ONLY use HTML and plain JavaScript for implementation.
* NEVER use React.
* For small-scale state data, store it in the URL as a query parameter
* Use the `localStorage` browser API for secrets storage or larger-scale state persistence, if needed.
* In general, don't use external JavaScript dependencies. If one is required, load it from a trusted external CDN.
